KDbg Release Notes for version 2.5.0
====================================

This release is based on KDE4 and Qt4.


Changes since 2.2.2
-------------------

- A number of icons were exchanged with Oxygen icons. These are not part
  of KDbg's source code.

- Session state per debugged program is now stored in a section in $KDEHOME
  rather than in a .kdbgrc file in the program's directory. This allows to
  debug programs that are located in unwritable directories. But this also
  means that earlier session information is disregarded.

- More accurate parsing of GDB responses of various commands fixed bugs in
  certain areas, in particular, temporary breakpoints, register values,
  truncated struct values, disassembly (again).

- "View Code" from the breakpoint list can open the source code in more cases.
