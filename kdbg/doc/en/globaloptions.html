<h1>
Global Options Dialog</h1>
<p>To specify some global options, choose <i>Settings|Global Options</i>. You
can set the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
the command by which gdb is invoked,</li>

<li>
the command that opens a terminal for the program's output,</li>

<li>
whether the KDbg shall pop into the foreground when the program stops and
a timeout when it shall go back again,</li>

<li>
the tab width,</li>

<li>
filters for source file names.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
How to invoke gdb</h4>

<blockquote>If you want to use a different version of gdb, you can specify
it under
<i>How to invoke GDB</i>. The default command is <tt>gdb --fullname
--nx</tt>. Be sure to also specify these options if you change the gdb
executable. If you leave them away, KDbg will not work. If you messed up
the entry, you can clear it to revert to the default setting.</blockquote>

<h4>
How to invoke a terminal emulator</h4>

<blockquote>If you want to use a different terminal program to show the
output of the program, specify it under <i>Terminal for program output</i>.
The default setting is <tt>xterm -name kdbgio -title %T -e sh -c %C</tt>.
In this entry,
<tt>%T</tt> will be replaced by a title string, <tt>%C</tt>
will be replaced by a Bourne shell script that loops infinitely so that
the terminal window doesn't close. (No, it doesn't use CPU, it calls <tt>sleep
3600</tt> in a loop :) An alternative for this setting could be <tt>konsole
--name kdbgio --caption %T -e sh -c %C</tt>.</blockquote>

<h4>
Pop into foreground</h4>

<blockquote>You can specify whether the KDbg window shall move itself into
the foreground as soon as the program being debugged stops (at a breakpoint
or due to a signal). The KDbg window is not activated, however (at least
under KWM, the KDE window manager). Some users may feel that this behavior
is intrusive, so this option is off by default.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If this option is on, KDbg will also retreat itself into the
background when the program is continued by any command, but it does so
only after a timeout that can be specified. This avoids that the debugger
window flashes back and forth each time you click any of the <i>Step</i>
commands.</blockquote>

<h4>
File filters</h4>

<blockquote>You can specify wildcards for source files and header files,
which are used in the file dialog of the <i>File|Open Source</i>
command.</blockquote>
