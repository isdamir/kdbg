<h1>
The Memory Dump Window</h1>
<p>The memory dump window is displayed using <i>View|Memory</i>. It displays
the contents of the program's memory at arbitrary adresses.</p>
<p>To display memory contents, enter an address in the edit field. The
address need not be given in hexadecimal form - it can be an expression.</p>
<p>You can specifiy a format how the memory contents shall be displayed
by chooseing the appropriate options from the popup menu that you invoke
by clicking the right mouse button.</p>
<p>A number of address expressions are remembered. You can recall such
an expression from the drop-down list. Please note that the address expression
is remembered together with the format.</p>
<p>If you don't need to investigate memory contents, it is recommended
that you clear the expression so that no memory dump is displayed - this
speeds up the debugging process.</p>
