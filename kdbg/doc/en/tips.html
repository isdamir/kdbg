Tips and Tricks</h1>

<ul>
<li>
You can use breakpoints as bookmarks: Just set a breakpoint and disable
it. Later, you can quickly come back to that breakpoint by double-clicking
it in the breakpoint list (or select it and click <i>View Code</i>). Since
breakpoints are persistent (i.e. KDbg remembers them across invocations
of a program), you get them back next time you invoke KDbg for that particular
program.</li>

<li>
You can display a value in the watch section in different ways by prepending
gdb's format specifiers in front of the variable to display. E.g. <tt>/x
var.member</tt> displays the <tt>var.member</tt> in hexadecimal notation.</li>

<li>
You can set breakpoints in a source files that belong to a shared library.
Such breakpoints will be marked as <em>orphaned</em> if the program is not active.
<A href="breakptlist.html#orphanedbp">Orphaned breakpoints</A> are not effective.
In order to make them effective, the program must stop at a time when the shared
library is loaded. For this it is usually sufficient to set a breakpoint in
<tt>main()</tt>. At the time when this breakpoint is hit, the orphaned breakpoints
in the shared library become effective.</li>

<li>
Debugging multi-threaded programs on NPTL-enabled Linux systems (kernel 2.6.x
or later and glibc 2.3.x or later) may sometimes fails; gdb stops the program
at unexpected instances. In this case the following may help (using bash):
<pre>
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.19 kdbg myprogram
</pre>I.e. you run KDbg from the command line such that the old
Linuxthreads implementation is used.</li>
</ul>
