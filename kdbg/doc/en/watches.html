<h1>
The Watched Expressions Window</h1>
<p>The watched expressions window is opened using <i>View|Watched Expressions</i>.
It displays arbitrary expressions.</p>
<p>To add an expression, type it into the edit field and press Enter or
click <i>Add</i>. To remove an expression, click on it (choose the root
of the expression) and click <i>Del</i>.</p>
<p>You can also move a variable or structure member from the <a href="localvars.html">local
variables window</a> to this window using the context menu in the local
variables window.</p>
<p>The values of most expressions can be changed. For this purpose, press F2
while the input focus is in the window. Then edit the value and hit Enter.
Note that you cannot modify the strings that <tt>char*</tt> values point
to in this way, just the pointer value.</p>
<p>Watched expressions are stored across debugging sessions. It is recommended
that you remove expressions that your don't need any longer because that
speeds up the debugging process.</p>
