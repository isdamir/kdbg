<h1>
The Threads Window</h1>
<p>The threads window is displayed using <i>View|Threads</i>. The threads
window lists the active threads of the program.</p>
<p><b><i>Note:</i></b> Debugging threaded programs must be supported by
the version of gdb that is used - it is not a feature of KDbg. For Linux
systems this works best with gdb5 and later. However, at the time of this writing gdb
still poorly supports threads on NPTL- (New Posix Threads Library) enabled
systems (glibc 2.3.x and kernel 2.6.x).</p>
<p>The contents of the threads window are updated every time the program
is stopped by the debugger. (That is, the window does <em>not</em> reflect
the state while the program is running.)</p>
<p>The first column shows the thread ID, the second column identifies the
location where the thread currently executes.</p>
<p>The marker in front of the line tells which thread currently is <em>active</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The <a href="stack.html">stack window</a> displays the active threads's
backtrace.</li>

<li>
The <a href="localvars.html">local variables</a> window displays the active
thread's local variables.</li>

<li>
The <a href="watches.html">watch window</a> uses the active thread's local
variables to evaluate the expressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>By clicking a listed thread, the active thread is switched, and the corresponding
windows are updated. In particular, the <a href="sourcecode.html">source
window</a> displays the location where the active thread is currently halted.</p>
