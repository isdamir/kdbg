KDbg Release Notes for version 2.2.0
====================================

The 2.2.x series is still based on Qt 3 and KDE 3.

Changes since 2.1.1
-------------------

Features:

- Source code windows have now a tab attached, which makes switching
  source files much easier.

- Source code windows now show line numbers at the left.

- There are now "Find Next" and "Find Previous" commands with shortcuts
  F3 and Shift+F3.

- Improved support of template types in the type tables (which are used
  to show structure members next to a structure variable). Notably, the
  number of elements in STL and Qt collection classes are shown.

- Arguments for the debugged program can be passed on KDbg's command line.

Bug fixes

- An incorrect terminal command string setting could crash KDbg if it
  contained format specifiers other than exactly one '%s'.

- The format specifier in the memory dump window was not correctly
  preserved when the expression is changed.

- Setting a conditional breakpoint could crash KDbg.

- Using Attach on systems that use the simplified Attach to Process dialog
  could crash KDbg.
