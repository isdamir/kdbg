This is KDbg, a graphical user interface around gdb using
KDE, the K Desktop Environment.

To install:

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/kde4 .
	make
	sudo make install

(Make sure your KDE is installed in /opt/kde4; adjust the path
to suit your system. On some systems it is /usr.)

Problem reports as well as success stories are welcome!

The homepage is at

	http://www.kdbg.org/

You'll find the most recent version of KDbg there as well as
other useful information concerning debugging.
